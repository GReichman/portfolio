        I am a growing software developer with experience in many different 
        languages and technologies. I have a bachelors degree in Computer
        Science from the University of Georgia and am currently taking part
        in a Full Stack Development bootcamp at Georgia Tech. <br/>

        My interest in technology started very young, with my Dad getting
        me into video games and later into PC building/upgrading. To this 
        day, gaming is still my favorite hobby. When it comes to both 
        games and books, my favorite genre is fantasy. I am currently 
        neck deep in a Brandon Sanderson binge, having recently finished The 
        Stormlight Archive series and immediately moving on to Mistborn.
