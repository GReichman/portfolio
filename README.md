# My Portfolio 
By: Garrett Reichman

## Description
  This project was made to build and display my proficiency with HTML and CSS. It is a website that can be used in the future (with some additions and changes) to allow prospective employers to view my information and projects that I have worked on. It contains a home page with my photo and a short bio about myself, a page with links to the projects I wish to display to employers, as well as a contact form to allow users to send me a message along with their email address and name.
